Stable Release

To install Pipenv Pipes, run this command in your terminal:

MacOs + Ubuntu:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip3 install pipenv-pipes --user

Windows:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip3 install pipenv-pipes
    $ pip3 install curses --find-links=https://github.com/gtalarico/curses-win/releases

.. note::
    Pipes requires the curses module, which is part of the python standard library.
    Unfortunately, curses it's currently not supported on Windows, so Windows users need to install
    the unofficial curses windows binaries, kindly created Christoph Gohlke.
    You can see the bug tracker on the issue `here <https://bugs.python.org/issue2889#msg237857>`_.
    To make this step easier, I have added a copy of the windows curses binaries to a
    `repo <https://github.com/gtalarico/curses-win>`_, but
    you can also download and install it yourself from the
    `author's page <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#curses>`_.

    If you haven't heard of Christoph, he has received a `PSF Community Service Award`_
    for his work in maintaining an impressive collection of Windows binaries.

This is the preferred method to install Pipenv Pipes,
as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_
can guide you through the process.

Known Issues
------------

``PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT`` is not currently supported.
If have ideas on how Pipes could support local venvs please start an issue
and include your proposed implementation.


Curses on Windows
-----------------

The interactive selector uses Curses, which is not natively supported on windows.
To enable curses on Windows we must install additional Windows binaries,
which were obtained from `here <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#curses>`_

The installer should automatically install the windows curses binaries if you include the ``find-link`` as shown above.
Should you need to install them manually,
just download the appropriate wheel from the link above and use pip to install it:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install ..packetPath..\curses-2.2-cpXX-none-win_XXX.whl

You can read more about windows support for curses here:

Terminal
~~~~~~~~

While Pipes should work on the standard Windows console (cmd.exe)
a terminal like `Cmder`_ is highly recommended:
