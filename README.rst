Overview
========

Poetry-poems is a tool that speeds up switching between Python Poetry-based projects by:

- activating Poetry shell at the same time.

Poetry-poems was inspired and is based on amazing project `pipenv-pipes - Pipenv Environment Switcher <https://github.com/gtalarico/pipenv-pipes>`_.
